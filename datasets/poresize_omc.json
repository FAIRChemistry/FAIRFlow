    "description": "The aim of this project is to introduce the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable) principles into miniplant flow chemistry",
    "purpose": "This dataset includes various measurements for distinct pore size-ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) materials, each loaded with 8% Cu. Specifically, the designations 7.1 nm and 9.2 nm denote the respective pore sizes. Notably, our sample preparation involved a comparative study on the impact of washing the sample with H2SO4"
